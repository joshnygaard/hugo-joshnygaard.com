This is my first post on my first very own live, publically accessible website! I hope you all like it. The goal of this site is to demonstrate to myself that I have the capabilities to create a public-facing website by myself. In future posts I will discuss the steps and decision I made in the development of this site But at the moment Iâ€™m just excited to get it live!
