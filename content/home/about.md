<!-- # About -->
I have recently moved to Pittsburgh, PA with my fianc√©, [Sandi](https://sandra-kruse.com) from Grand Forks, ND. We both attended the [University of North Dakota](https://und.edu) and grew up in small towns in the state. We are both excited to be starting an exciting new chapter for both of our professional lives.

While at UND I benefitted from a liberal arts education, allowing me to take classes in a number of disciplines. During university I discovered and cultivated interests in physics, history, and political science--ultimately pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. With the rest of my career still ahead of me I am looking forward to expand my experience and expertise in software engineering, data analytics, data visualization, machine learning, and who knows what other fields I may discover along the way.

When I am not developing myself professionally I am likely to be playing anything published by [Paradox Interactive](https://paradoxplaza.com), or enjoying the outdoors with my friends and family, whether by hiking, camping, or drinking on a patio (North Dakotan weather permitting). I come from a unique family composed of a retired U.S. Air Force father and an English-born Mother, who only wanted a single child, but instead got triplets.
